# OAKTREE

<a href="https://user5142.github.io/OAKTREE/" target="_blank">OAKTREE</a> is a fictitious cybersecurity brand and landing page that I designed and built for a project called Company Home Page with Flexbox as part of Codecademy's Front-End Engineer Path.

I wrote a <a href="https://breakpoints.dev/articles/oaktree" target="_blank">blog article</a> about the process, tools and techniques I used to create OAKTREE.
