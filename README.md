# OAKTREE

<a href="https://user5142.github.io/OAKTREE/" target="_blank">OAKTREE</a> is a fictitious cybersecurity consulting company that I created for a project called Company Home Page with Flexbox as part of Codecademy's Full Stack Engineer Career Path.

I wrote a <a href="https://breakpoints.dev/articles/OAKTREE" target="_blank">blog article</a> about the process, tools and techniques I used to devise the OAKTREE brand and landing page.
